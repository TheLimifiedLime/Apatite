# Basil

## What is Basil?

Basil is a tool that opens a specific URL when in between certain timestamps. This can be useful for when you have a set schedule and open the same URL during a certain time period.

## How To Use

Refer to the [setup instructions](docs/SETUP.md).

## Known Issues

- Basil currently does not work on a mobile filesystem. A hosted version has not been tested on mobile.
- Currently the fallback page sorts the fallback items with subsequent time periods in a column going down instead of left to right. This may be changed in the future
- Text size on mobile is too large
- The fallback page only has a dark theme
